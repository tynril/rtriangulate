A Rust implementation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm presented by
[Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/).

Find the crate documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/rtriangulate), or
[here on Github](https://tynril.github.io/rtriangulate).

This was developed as an exercise to get more used to Rust. As far as I know, it works, but it
might not. Also, this is a O(n<sup>1.5</sup>) (approximatively) algorithm, it's not parallelized,
and it doesn't use the GPU at all.

## Usage

Add the rtriangulate dependency to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rtriangulate = "0.2"
```

And use the crate as such:

```rust
extern crate rtriangulate;

use rtriangulate::{Point, triangulate};

fn main() {
    // A list of points (which has to be sorted on x).
    let points = [Point::new(10.0, 50.0), Point::new(30.0, 40.0), Point::new(25.0, 40.0)];
    let triangles = triangulate(&points).unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", triangles); // [Triangle(0, 1, 2)]
}
```
